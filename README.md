# About this Repository

Welcome! This is just an archive of a team project I wrote for my C++ class during my final semester of high school. Appropriate credits will be given to my teammate.
- If you are learning the C++ programming language, I highly encourage you to analyze all the code as there are comments EVERYWHERE explaining what does what.

# About the Program

This is a little convenience store with 5 different categories of products
(each with 5 items).

The list of categories are:
- food
- beverages
- health/self care
- cleaning
- miscellaneous (other)
(yes, the data of each item will be entered from an external file)

Users will be able to navigate through each category, add items to their cart,
check their inventory, and finally enter checkout

Finally, once the user enters checkout, they will be prompted to select the city
(limited to San Francisco, Fresno, Los Angeles, and Monterey) for the purpose of tax.
They will have a total, subtotal, etc. The receipt will be in an external file.

# Who did what?

I did most of the code, from the menus, to the catalog class, and the functioning user cart.
My teammate created the user checkout, including the tax rates based on real cities in the American state of California.

# Can I reuse any of this code for MY group project?
